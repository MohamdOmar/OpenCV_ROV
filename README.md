# Image Processing for Underwater ROV (Prototype Stage)

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Python** and **OpenCV** for basic image processing algorithms aimed at enabling object detection in underwater environments. The goal was to develop functionality that could be integrated into a **Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV)** for real-time visual processing and underwater navigation applications.

## Features
- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Implements basic algorithms for detecting and tracking objects in underwater images.
- **Edge Detection**: Utilizes OpenCV's edge detection features to identify objects and boundaries in the underwater environment.
- **Noise Reduction**: Applies filters to reduce noise and enhance the clarity of underwater images for better object recognition.
- **Prototyping Stage**: The project focuses on laying the groundwork for more complex ROV systems, including navigation and mapping.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **OpenCV**  
- **NumPy**

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MohamdOmar/OpenCV_ROV.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure that your environment has access to an image/video stream for testing the algorithms.
